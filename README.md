This software was developed at the [Department of 
Mathematics, Dartmouth College][DartmouthMath] and the 
[Department of Mathematics & Statistics, University of Michigan - Dearborn][DearbornMath], 
and is released under the MIT license.

The software was developed and tested using Matlab 
R2023b. 


## Instructions

Extract the contents of the zip file and execute, in Matlab, scripts from the folder. 
The code refers to the CCD challenge dataset available at the SDMS website [here][CCD_GOTCHA].
